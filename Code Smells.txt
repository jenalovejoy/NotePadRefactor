"Code Smells" (ordered by importance)
    - Method actionPerformed() is far too long
    - Save, Paste, Print conditions could be extracted into their own methods
    - actionPerformed() has a long, complex if/else statement 
    - Line 93 - entire print method inside of another method
    - "returnVal" only used as a temp in if statement, so fc.showSaveDialog(null) can just be called in the if statement
    - Poor variable names
    - Line 37-59 could be refactored such that there are not repeated GUI setup statements
    - Line 71 - e.getActionCommand() is called in each if statement, could be saved in one variable so it's not continually called
    - Get rid of undo
