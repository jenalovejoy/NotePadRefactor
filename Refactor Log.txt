Refactor Log

    - Reorganize GUI Construction
        - All variable names moved from 1-2 letters to descriptive names. Names include what they are tied to, and what type of element they are for consistency and clarity
        - All menuItems put into array -> each have addActionListener() and setActionCommand() applied to them, so this is accomplished with a for-each to reduce duplicated code

    - Restructure actionPerformed()
        - Long if/else sections extracted into their own methods to clean actionPerformed(), making it more straightforward and easy to read quickly. Extracted methods include:
            - Save
            - Print
            - Paste
        - Copy and New only include one statement, so those were left as-is
        - If/else transitioned to switch statement to make it easier to read

    - Clean saveFile()
        - fc.showSaveDialog(null) moved outside of returnVal, as returnVal is only used once. fc.showSaveDialog(null) called in the one occurance
