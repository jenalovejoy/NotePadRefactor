Code Refactoring

    1. Solve: Undescriptive, confusing variable names make the rest of the program hard to parse

        While functionally this is not the biggest issue, it was the first to fix to make interacting 
        with the rest of the code and GUI elements more straightforward. The 1-2 letter variable names 
        now follow a consistent, descriptive format.

        JMenuItems end with "MenuItem", Menus end with "menu" so that any individual name can be quickly classified

    2. Solve: Method actionPerformed() is too bloated/long, 
              actionPerformed() has a long, complex if/else statement 
              Save, Paste, Print conditions could be extracted into their own methods

        Created NotePadUtils class to hold abstracted methods. Save and Print each individually have 
        saveFile() and printFile() within this.
        Paste had unnecessary lines of code, which were then removed, leaving "d.paste()" alone.

        Once the if/else was paired down to abstracted methods, it was translated to a switch statement 
        for better readability and fewer unnecessary characters.

        Within NotePadUtils, "open" was broken into more methods to allow recent file tracking and separation 
        of selecting a file and opening said file. 

    3. Solve: GUI element set-up has many repeated statements

        Each type of GUI element object was placed into an array by type of functionality (file or edit).
        Those arrays are iterated over to reduce repeated code and connect the necessary elements to menu bars, 
        and listeners to elements. In moving to an array, there is some increased logic required for tracking index, 
        but overall extraneous code is removed.

    4. Solve: "returnVal" only used as a temp in if statement, so fc.showSaveDialog(null) can just be called in the if statement

        Did exactly that.

    5. Solve: e.getActionCommand() is called in each if statement, could be saved in one variable so it's not continually called

        Saved in a variable to avoid repeated calls

    6. Solve: Undo does not currently provide any functionality

        Removed undo method and condition
